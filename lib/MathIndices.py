            1:
            raising a number to the power of zero will always equal 1. For example 20^0 = 1
            2:
            When multiplying two numbers raised to a power, if the bases are the same then add the indices.
            For example 2^3 * 2^4 = 2^3+4 = 2^7
            3:
            if you are dividing, then subtract the indices. for example: 2^5 / 2^2 = 2^5-2 = 2^3
